clOS

Kernel for experimental filesystem/OS in which executing programs are isolated within their working directory. Files and folders do not have permissions- instead, unelevated programs executing in userspace are sandboxed within the directory from which they were executed (by their parent process).



toolchain

For now, the project uses a simple i686-elf target. You may find this on your distro's repos, though binaries are available here: 
https://github.com/rm-hull/barebones-toolchain



building & running

$ . toolchain/setenv.sh     # If i686-elf toolchain not on PATH
$ cd kernel
$ make clean
$ make run
